# SongGenXML

**One-Line Summary:** AI songwriting with XML: flexible control for musicians of all levels. 

## Vision

* To empower musicians of all skill levels to interact meaningfully with AI-powered music tools.  Right now 'most' of the AI music creation tools out there are catoring to the novice (non-musician).  Thats great as far as inclusivity goes however it can be incredibly frustraiting for us longtime old school musicians that know what we have and have a vision in our hears and minds.  I know even though my music is AI assisted I still have to generate sometimes hundreds of times to get what I need (e.g., song structure, vocal phrasing, instrument choice) to edit and create my own compositions with the output in my Pro Tools DAW.

## Problem It Solves

* Existing AI music generators often lack the granular control experienced musicians desire. 
* Generating numerous song variations to achieve a specific vision is time-consuming and creatively draining.
* SongGenXML addresses these pain points by providing a structured yet user-friendly way to communicate musical ideas to AI, balancing simplicity with expressive control.

## How It Works (Basics)

* Users create simple XML files outlining:
    * Song title, genre, and mood
    * Basic tempo, time signature, and rhythm
    * Vocal structure (verses, chorus, etc.)
    * Lyrics with instructions for phrasing, emphasis, and emotion

* The AI music generator interprets the XML and produces a song aligned with the provided instructions.

## Invitation to Collaborate

We're seeking music enthusiasts, AI developers, and anyone passionate about shaping the future of music creation.  Here's how you can contribute:

* **Share Ideas:** Help refine the XML structure and suggest new features
* **Build the Tools:** Develop code to process XML and interact with AI music generators
* **Test & Provide Feedback:**  Try generating songs with the system and share your experience.

## Getting Started
