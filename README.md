AI songwriting with XML: flexible control for musicians of all levels.

README Draft: SongGenXML

Project Title: SongGenXML

One-Line Summary: AI songwriting with XML: flexible control for musicians of all levels.

Your Vision (Placeholder)

Briefly describe your overarching goals for the project. Emphasize how it aims to empower musicians of all skill levels to interact with AI-powered music tools in a meaningful way.
Problem It Solves

Existing AI music generators often lack the granular control experienced musicians desire.
Generating numerous song variations to achieve a specific vision is time-consuming and creatively draining.
SongGenXML addresses these pain points by providing a structured yet user-friendly way to communicate musical ideas to AI, balancing simplicity with expressive control.
How It Works (Basics)

Users create simple XML files outlining:

Song title, genre, and mood
Basic tempo, time signature, and rhythm
Vocal structure (verses, chorus, etc.)
Lyrics with instructions for phrasing, emphasis, and emotion
The AI music generator interprets the XML and produces a song aligned with the provided instructions.
